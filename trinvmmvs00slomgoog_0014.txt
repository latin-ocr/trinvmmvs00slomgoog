PREFACE.

ant Text of the present edition of the Trinummus is
based on that of Fleckeisen, but the arrangement of the lines
in the Canticum has been taken mainly from Ritschl. It has
not, however, been thought right to admit into a School
edition all the archaic forms introduced by these editors.
On the same principle the letter u has been admitted.

References have always been made, where practicable, to
lines counted from the beginning of a play, rather than to the
Act and Scene. Of some plays, however, no edition num· ’
bered on the modern system is readily accessible, andin
⁴ such cases the old method has been preserved.

In the text the numbering by Act and Scene, which has
been retained hythe side of the newer system, follows the
Ambrosian palimpsest, even where irregularities in the se-
quence of the lines are caused by disarrangement in the
manuscript. .

Verses of doubtful authority are enclosed in brackets,
a few which are more than doubtful have been relegated to
the notes3 two have been omitted for other reasons. Words
or letters not found in the MSS. are printed in italics.
