vi PREFACE.

intended to represent concisely some of the more important
results ol modern research on this difficult subject. The
materials have been mainly drawn from Wagner's Introduc·
tion to the Aulularia, and Introduction to the Trinutnmus of
J. Brix. Α

It is hoped that the scenic directions partly suggested by
stage experience at Westminster, may be of some service in
the intelligent reading of the play.

For aid in the exposition of the text we are under great
obligations to the admirable edition of the Trinummus by
Julius Brix. We have also consulted the notes of W. Wagner,
Lindemann and others.

It is hardly necessary to mention that in matters of textual
criticism we have on all occasions made use of F. Ritschl’s
elaborate collation of the MSS.
