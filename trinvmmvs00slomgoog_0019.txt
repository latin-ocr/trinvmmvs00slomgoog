a Latin literature, which was continued by an unbroken suc-
cession of writers down to the days of Cicero.

For a long time the Romans had possessed a stage without
a drama. Since 364 Β. c. the first three days of the Ludi
Romani had been occupied with stage performances ; but these
consisted merely of recitations by strolling ballad singers, of
rough saturae, uncouth and inharmonious, composed in the
Saturnian mene, without dialogue or plot· The native wit of
Latium had gone no further3 and now when people, incited
by the example of Greece, began to ask sor a real drama, they
found no stock among themselves on which they could draw.
To wait for the gradual growth of a true Roman drama was
impossible: the requirements of the stage could not be so long
postponed‚ and the one alternative was accepted-the trans·
lation and adaptation of those plays which were then sashion-
able at Athens. A sew words must be spent in explaining the
character of this class os literature, since, by its reproduction
at Rome, it has secured an immortality which otherwise would
have been denied it. ἱ ¹

The New comedy. Times had changed at AthenS, since·
Aristophanes had employed the stage for the purpose of de-
nouncing and ridiculing his political opponents; since he had
brought before the eyes of his audience the gods, the philoso-
phers, and the statesmen of his country—Dionysus descending
to Hades in the attire of Heracles‚ Socrates surveying the sun
from his basket, or Cleon attacked by the sausage-seller and
the Knights. The Old Comedy, as it is called, could not
survive the decay of national spirit or the loss of national
liberty. The representation upon the stage of public and
political life would have been absurd when public and political
life worthy of the name had ceased to exist. Men cannot enjoy
aparody when they do not recognise its subject. And so for
the half century between the battle of Chaeronea (338 rac.)
and about 290 B.c. (when the centre of Greek learning shifted

to Alexandria), the genius of Athens was turned to the pro.
duction of the New Comedy. This is broadly distinguished
