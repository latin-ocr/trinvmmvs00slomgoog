xii INTRODUCTION.

Umbria, about 254 B.c.; but the meagre notices of his lile
which we possess do not enable us to fix the date precisely.
He appears to have come to Rome at an early age, and to
have got some work connected with the stage, in which he
managed to save money. He invested his savings in foreign
trade (see line 331 note), and lost them. Being thus reduced to
poverty he came back to Rome, and worked as a hired servant
at a mill ; and it was at this time that he began to· write plays
His literary career continued till his death, 184 tac. ; but we
do not know exactly when it began. Plautus, as might be
expected, makes little reference to contemporary events ; and
there is nothing in his plays that points to a date earlier than
210-207 tac. In the Miles Gloriosus (line 21⁴2) he speaks of
the imprisonment of Naevius, which appears to have taken
place at that time. Many os his plays may have been written
before the Miles3 sor, if they were wanted for exhibition in the
year of the battle of the Metaurus, or in that immediately
preceding it, they may have found an audience all through the
second Punic War.

His Plays. In the days of the grammarian Varro (died 27
B. c), no less than a hundred and thirty plays were attributed to
Plautus. Of these Varro considered twenty-one to be undoubt-
edly genuine; and all but one (the Vidularia) on his list have
come down to us. The T rz'uummus was adapted from the
Θῃσαυρός of Philemon, and was first produced at the Megalesian
games not earlier than 194 Β. c. (see ¹line 990 note); the* most
probable date is 188 tac. In modern times it hasbeen imitated
by Lessing in Schatz, as the Amphitruo by Moliere and Dryden
in plays of the same name, the Aulularia by Moliere in L'Avare,
and the Menaechmi (directly or indirectly) by Shakspeare in the
Comedy of Errors. The true spelling of the poet’s name, which
used to be written incorrectly M. Accius Plautus, bas been
recovered from the Ambrosian palimpsest. His cognomen
Plautus means ‘fiat-footed,' and the additional name Asinius,
sound in some MSS, is a corruption of Sassiam, ‘a native ol ἰ
Sassina?
