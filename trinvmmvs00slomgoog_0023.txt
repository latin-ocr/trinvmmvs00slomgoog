os the publica negotia (331), of the Cluerztes (471), ot' the Syriau
and Campanian slaves (542, 545), of the dialect of Praeneste
(609), 01 the dictator (695), of Neptune (820), of the aediles
(990), of the punishment 01 crucifixion (1040). Set by the side
of these the mentiones nummi Philippei (152), of the thousand
drachmae, owed 10 the banker Olympicus (425), of the two (not
three) guests 0112 couch at dinner (469), of bills of exchange
(982), ol silver minae (1082), 01 the Piraeus, which Stasimus is
to reach without stopping (1103). To these we must addthe
genuine Greek words employed, παῦσαι (117), οἴχεται (419),
πάλιν (705), ἐπιθήκη (1025). Very similar, again, are Greek words
adopted into Latin, graphicus (1024), with its adverb graphia
(770), thermapalr'um (1013) with the barbarous thermopdtara
(1014), paterium (1017), basilicas (1030). Note too words plainly
coined from the Greek, turpilucricupidus (100), vanidicus (275),
falsidicus (770).

But, 011 the other hand, Plautus is thoroughly national and
briginal in the most striking characteristic 01 his dramas, in
plays upon words, in alliteration and assonance, and in asyn-
deta. These were not, and indeed could not be, taken from
any foreign source3 firstly, because they did not exist in the
Greek writers, from whom Roman Comedy borrowed; and
secondly, it would be as difficult to produce them by translation,
as to maintain a long conversation in a whisper. It may be
worth while to cite the most striking instances. We find invitus
ni id me invitet (27), raptores ,110011 et peni (254), pal pudm
quam pigere praestat (345),211110 example of alliteration and
assonance combined, inmaenis and maenus (354), vi Veneni
vinctus (6 58),marrs hominum maros et marosas efficit (669), laetus
labens laudas aga (821), besides 1003—4, 1011, and many others.
Asyndeton is common enough, eg. labitur liquitur (242), in-
periis praeceptat (302), sarta tecta (317), matumst tacet (1005).
Metaphors too must grow up naturally in a language; they·
would be unintelligible it they were imported into it; and so
we havel either those which might belong to any language eg. .
