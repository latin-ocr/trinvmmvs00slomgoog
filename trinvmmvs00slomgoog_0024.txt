of good principles as the integumentum vz'tae (313) ; or such as ’
are distinctly Roman, e. g. ferentarium amicum (456), os quoi
sublinat (558), and concenturz'ant metum (1002). .

As we do not possess anything but fragments of the New
Comedy, from which the Roman dramatists borrowed, it is
impossible to estimate the amount of originality‚ which belongs
to any play of Plautus taken as a whole ; but the ease and
vigour of his language would show clearly that he was treating
his models with some freedom‚ if this fact were not also evident
from the numerous Roman allusions, to which reference has
already been made.

Plautus and his audience. Plautus’ early connexion with
the stage gave him the experience requisite sor writing a good
acting play. We see it in the broad humour of the dialogum,
in the variety of the action, and in the dramatic character os the
situations. And, besides he knew well for whom he was writing3
and his audience was not of a high class. The greater the
extravagance, the more amusement it gave ; and it is to the
knowledge ol this that we must attribute the production os part
ol the fourth act of the T rinummus. We can imagine how the
excitable spectators screamed with laughter when the Syco-
phant calmly declared that Arabia was in PontuS, and how
eagerly they waited to see if his effrontery would support
him in declaring that he had positively been introduced to
Jove.

Appreelation of Plautus. The popularity of Plautus con-
tinued very great for some time after his death, until his plays
were gradually superseded hythe more polished comedy of
Terence. Cicero, however (de Off. i. 29), classes his wit with
theAtticorum antz’qua comoedia ; but in the last years of the
Republic and the early years of the Empire the rhetorical
character ol education led men to prefer tragedy to comedy.
Horace acknowledges the general appreciation of the vivacity
ol style and action so conspicuous in Plautus ; for (Epist. ii. 1.
58) he says dicz'tur. . . Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare
Ennianum but his own opinion is disparaging (A. Ρ. 270-4).
