unmarried daughter to the care of his friend Callicles3 and,
before sailing, had secretly buried within his house a large sunu
of money.

Lesbonicus, however, having spent all the money that could
be otherwise raised, put up the house for sale. Callicles, to
whom alone the secret of the treasure had been entrusted,
bought it for a small price and took up his abode therein.

Aet Ι. So. 1. At this point the action of the Play com·
mences. Megaronides, an out-spoken friend of Callicles, has
heard of the apparent haseness of his conduct and comes to

suade Philto to reject the land, and no final arrangement is
concluded.

AetIII. Sol. When the curtain rises at the next Act
Callicles is informed by Stasimus of the proposed marriage,
but can hardly believe the story, and goes off to ask the advice
of Megaronides.

A despondent soliloquy of Stasimus is interrupted hythe
