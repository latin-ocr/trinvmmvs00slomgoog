Aet 111. So. 2. Lysiteles endeavours to prevail on Lesbon
icus not to insist upon the doury: he forcibly depicts the im·
pending tuin ol the family: but Lesbonicus is proud aud obsti·
nate: he cannot endure the thought of what his sellow-citizens
might say, were his sister, without a penny of ber own, to marry
so rich a inan ; and at last breaks away abruptly, followedby
Lysiteles, Stasimus being lest alone to paint in a few graphio

Aet 111. So. 3. Meanwhile Callicles, acting on the advioe
of Megaronides, determines t0 provide a dowry for the young
lady from the hidden treasure. The difficulty is how to do
so without arousing the suspicions of Lesbonicus who would
quickly make away with the remaining money if he became
aware of its existence. Megaronides hits on the following
device. A man is to be hired to personate amessenger from
Charmides. The impostor is to pretend that he brings letters
and a remittance in money for Callicles; and then all will be
easily done. This plan is at once carried into effect.

Act IV. So. 1. Charmides, however, unexpectedly appears
in person, having just landed at the Piraeus after a bad passage. Ἴ
He dilates in some sonorous lines on the perils of the deep, y
and is just about to enter his house when he encounters the ς

Aet IV. So. 2. ln an amusing scene, Charmides,whose suspi.
cions are at once aroused, questions the Sycophant as to his name
and business. The Sycophant replies with evasive answers and 3
preposterous absurdities, though he makes no secret of his pre· 1
tendederrand. When challenged he cannot give the name of ‘his
friend’ who had entrusted the ‘ 1000 gold pieces⁵ to his charge;
but even that only sor a moment disturbs his sels-assurance.

At length Charmides discloses his identity, and demands the

money. The Sycophant is at first incredulous‚ and when finally
convinced covers his retreat with brazen impudence.
