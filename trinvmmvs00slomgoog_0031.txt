Any monosyllabic preposition may be shortened by dropping
its final consonant, e. g. ab and ad may be scanned ἃ, ex as δ’,
etc. Final a, e, 1, o, are all occasionally shortened both in
nouns and verbs. ’

ΙΙ. The shortening of an unaccented syllable in order to
throw all the stress on the accented syllable is thus expressed
in a formula by Wagner od. = υυ-ἰ andin trochaics -ω- =
Lou- This occurs most frequently at the beginning of a verse.
Instances are ferlnlcirz‘um 456, volentate 1166, quid tibi intir-
pellatio 709, pote‘st fleri 730, tablrndculo 726, dedtsttn 129, sl
mage legere 1052, sed {alric 88, quid lstlc 573, hle quoque hinc
cibz'z‘t 718, quia dmnls 78. Brix and Wagner maintain that inde
and riade may be shortened, even when standing at the begin-
ning of a line in trochaic metre.

Ill. syntzesis. Any case of meus, tuuc, suus may be mono-

syllable-in fact almost any two vowels coming together may
be thus contracted: e.g. Ξῖ, ez‘us, iorum, ᾖε, rii, du'as, dt‘es,
diaetae. ,
To show how greatly scansion depended on accent eius, lartius,
quoius, are indifferently used as trochees‚ pyrrhics‚ or mono-
syllables. Compounds in which two vowels come together
are regularly contracted, e.g. pra‘ffiptare. Double letters were
probably not written in the time of Plautus, and consequently
vowels when unaccented are sreely shortened before double
consonants: dccrclto 712, dccejrbti 964, satffllites 833, Philip>-
peus 152.

Archaic long terminations are occasionally retained by Plautus
(rarely by Terence) where the rhythm of the verse requires thern:
e.g. samz'lz'ct (nom. sing.) 251 3-or (ωρ) in nom. sing. of nouns
and comparative adjectives 226 ;—bus in dat. and abl. plur.; and
the verb endings is (eis), at (ait), e't (eit), rt (iit) : cf. 206. Es
(from sum) is always long in Plautus,

Hiatus is generally acknowledged to be admitted byPlautus‚

(1) Where the line is divided among two or more speakerS,
⁸8· 4323 .

(2) Where there isa distinct pause in the sense, e.g. 185,1018;
