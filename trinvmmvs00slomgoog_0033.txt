Vulgate. It is very imperfect. · Many pages are entirely lost¹,
several are all but illegible. Ritschl describes it as ⁴ abominably
washed out and scraped, blotted out hythe later writing to an
extraordinary degree, cankered, wormeaten, its leaves moulder-
ing and stuck together from neglect and damp, lastly to a great
degree miserably mutilated.’

Codices B, C, and D have all been corrected hy a second, if
not hya third hand, and all are probably derived from one
original-C and D being contemporary transcripts.

That there have been a good many omissions in the existing
MSS. is proved by the quotations which are found in other
writers but not in the plays themselves; the corruptions which
have crept in (especially in B) are numerous and often absurd;
and there can be little doubt that not a few lines have been
interpolated.

One reason of the scarcity and corruption of Plautine MSS.
is that the early comedies were not published in a literary sense
at all. The author was paid so much for translating aplay, just
as the Choragvs was paid so much for dressing it—with one
important difference, namely that the pay of the author de·
pended on the success of his piece. Consequently the only
copies in existence would be actors’ copies, and these would
naturally become corrupted by glosses‚ interpolations‚ and
omissions

Since, therefore, the MSS. are so few and their authority so
uncertain, critical emendations of the text for internal reasons
have more justification than otherwise could be the case—espe-
cially where A fails 3 indeed a strict conservatism is soon found
to be wholly impossible
