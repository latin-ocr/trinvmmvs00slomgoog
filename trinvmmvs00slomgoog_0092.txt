NOTES.

Trinummus. The title is derived from the tres nummi (drachmae)
given to the Sycophant 843-4. The notices, called διδασκαλίαι, con-
ceming the origin and first performauce ol Plautine and Terentian
comedies, were inserted after the titles in the MSS. probably by gram·
mariaus of the Augustan age.

Ludis Megalensibus. These were the games celebrated April
4th-9th iu honour of the Magna (μεγάλη) Mater or Cybele, a Phrygian

Prologus. Of the twenty extant plays of Plautus eight have no
Prologues‚ and Pseudolus only a fragment of two lines. Of the other
eleven Prologues, nine give an analysis of the plot, at greater or less
