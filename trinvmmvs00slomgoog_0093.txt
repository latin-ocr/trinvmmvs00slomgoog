60 PLA VT I TRINVMM VS.

the Prolognes are meant to be delivered in character; viz. in the
Trinummus by Luxuria and Inopia, in the Aulularia by the Lar Fami-
liaris, in the Amphitruo by Mercury, in the Mercator by Charinus (a
character in the play), in the Rudens by Arcturus. The Prologues are
sometimes of considerable length, e. g. 152 lines in the Amphitruo, and
often contain remarks as to the proper behavionr of the audience, as in
the Poenulus, where nurses are requested not to introduce babies, ‘nc ct
ipsm sitiant, ct pueri percant samm neve esurientes dic quasi haedi
obvagzant!

Plautine prologues do not contain personal answers to criticisms, such·
as we sometimes find in Terence; which is natural enough, since most
of them are certainly later additions—not earlier than the first or second
century nc.

The Prologue of the Trinummus has the best claim to be considered
genuine.

Line 1. hao sc. via.

munus fungaris tuom: fungor govems the accusative in
Plautus and Terence: cf. 354. The only exception is in Ter. Ad. 603.
where the MSS. give the ablative. Cf. Ter. Ad. 464, Phor. 281. Utor
and potior are sometimes found with the accusative before and after the
Angustan age: Ter. Ad. 871 ‘ patria potitur commoda ;' ib. 815, ib. 876:
cf. infra, 682. Frueris found once with accusative in Terence, Heaut.
401, elsewhere with the ablative.

3. em=cn in the comic poets. Itis to be distinguished from Hem. ο
an interjection used to arrest attention or express any strong emotion.
Cf. 185 note, 413, 531, 603, 923.

Em is not elidedz cm illac being scanned eitherlm ma? or im’lla’e.

in viam. etc, ‘I will set you on the right track.’

5. dare. The pree. inf. is often used for the fut. inf. in the comic
writers after verbs of hoping, promising, threatening, etc. Cf. Aul.
108, Ter. And. 238. Similarly in Greek the pres. inf. is sometimes used
with a continuous force after verbs of hoping and the like, where the
fut. inf. is more frequently found: e. g. ἐλπίζει δυνατὸς εἶναι ἄρχειν, Plato
Rep. ix, 573: see Goodwin’s Greek Moods and Tenses, page 14.
