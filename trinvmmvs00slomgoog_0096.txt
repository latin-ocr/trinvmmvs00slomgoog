48. Ritschl and most oi the modern editors consider the words atque

(1) oi the awkward hiatus after salve,

(a) oi the disregard os the question by Megaronides,

(3) os the unusual position oi the name Megaronides.
Were the MSS. better and more numerous, words found in all could not
be thus rejected. But in the case ot Plautus, probably the only MSS.
in existence were actor‘s copies, and these would be very likely to have
emendations or amplifications of the text written on the margins, and by
later copyists incorporated with the text itseli. The present words are
just such as an actor might have inserted in order to let the audience
know the name oi Megaronides. See Introduction on the MSS. oi
Plautus.
