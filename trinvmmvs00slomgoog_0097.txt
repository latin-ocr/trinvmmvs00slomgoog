64 PLA VT I TRINVMMUS. 1. 2. 10-24.

l. 49. edepol. The first syllable is the old interjectione as in equidem,
ecastor, etc.: potr-Pollux. Edepol is commonly used by men, ecastor
by women.

50. valent the ordinary contractiori for volesne: so valuistin =
valuistine: vin=oisne, 59.

58. herole; the first syllable is shortened in the Theseis.

59. volo may be followed-

(1) by simple infinitive,

(2) by aec. and inf.. cf. 324. ἵ

(3) by ut with subjunctive; the ut being sometimes omitted, as
here. Cf. 372·

60. ‘l'll be bound that you will not have deceived meas much as

that little bit' (with a gesture).

faxo=fecero. The future perfect is often used in Plautus and
Terence to express a quickly completed future action, where in English ·
we should employ the future simple. Cf. 1οο7. Faxo stands parentheti-
eally as in 61; or followed by a future ind. cf. Ter. Phor. 1055 Jam
hic faxo adarim or by a subjunctive; cf. 882, Ter. Ad. 845-7; cf.
faxim ²213 Zumpt's Lat. Gr. ξ 511.

dare verba= ‘to deceive)

tantillum is similarly used, with agesture ‘ deierandi& 483: Ter.
Ad. 563 quem ego modo puerum tantillum in manibus gestavi meis.

hau is a Plautiae form of leand, used before consonants.

61. namque enim. Enim is often found withan intensive force.
giving emphasis to the word preceding or following. Cf. 705, 806,
919,1134; Ter. Ad. 656 Quid illas censes? Nihil enim; Ter. And.
503 Certe enim scio. Cf. Liv. aa, ²5³ Virg. G. a, 509. Namque
enim are not found in this connection elsewhere, but we have the
similar expressions, nonaque hercle, infra 731, nomque edepol, six times
in Plautus, nomque ecastor, Cist. 71. Various conjectures have been
made to avoid the namque enim which is the reading of all the MSS,
eg. nempe enim (Ritschl); nanctum enim te credis quem . . ,(Wagner);
nunquam (Camerarius). The connexion of ideas is as follows:-
Callicles says, ‘I warrant you won’t have deceived me in the least?
Megaronides replies, ‘(I should think not) for assuredly ’tis you,
Ι think, who will have stolen a march upon me unawares.’

obrepo in Augustan Latin governs a dative.
Some of the modern editors (e. g. Ritschl and Brix) have changed
the order of lines 59-643 the text preserves the order of the MSS.
The scansion is no'mqn(e) enlm.
61. ne (sometimes printed nae), an affirmative particle always J'oined

to pronouns, sometimes with the addition of hercle, edepol, and the like.
Gr. νή, nul. Cf. 634, 760, 952.
