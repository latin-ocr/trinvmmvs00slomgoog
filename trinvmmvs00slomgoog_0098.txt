1. a. ²7·49· NOTEs. LINES 49-86. 65

l. 65. ut bene vivitur, diu vivitur. Callicles closes these bantering
remarks with a moral platitude; ‘Well truly‚ according as one lives
virtuously one lives long? Cf. Seneca de Brevitate Vitae, cap. 8 Nou
estquod quenquam propter canos aut rugas putes diu vixisse: nou ille
diu vixit sed diu fuit. Most of the modern editors transpose bene and .
diu, against the MSS.

67. quid=‘whyl'

68. obiurgitem. Ritschl reads obiurigem (an older form of obiurga)
from the reading of A, OBIVR. .EM. It is very seldom that a
substantive is found with two epithets unconnected by any conjunction,
ashere. Cf. 1045.

72. aegrotant. Cf. 30. artes‚‘qualities.' antiquae. Cf. Ter. Ad.
44² homo' . . . antiqua virtute etfide. In the MSS. follow these three
lines (except in A, which has not the first line at all)-

Siu immutare uis ingenium moribus

Aut si demutant mores ingenium tuum,

Neque eos antiquos seruas ast captus nouos.
Tbese lines are rejected as interpolations by Ritschl, Brix. and Wagner.
The first is not found in A; the second and third merely repeat in other
words the idea expressed in 72. See Introduction on Plautine MSS.
and note on 48.

76. videre audireque aegroti, ‘sick at seeing and hearing you ;’ a
rare construction, the infinitives following aegroti sient which may be
considered as equivalent to oderint. Cf. Merc. 4. 5. 3 Defessus sum
urbem tutam peruenerier.

sient archaic form of siut. Plautus also uses siem, sies, stet. Cf.
267 note.
77. qui, see 14, note. istaec, cf. hercle 58, fstuc 88.
78. quia omnis, scanned as a single foot.
adcurare ad-deoet. Plautus is fond of such strengthened forms:
addecet for dccet is found only in Plautus and Ennius.

80. non potest, scanned as one foot. For potest used impersonally
‘it is possible‚’ cf. 731; Ter. Phor. 303.

81. promus (deriv. pronto); he who gives out provisions, etc. ; a
steward or butler. ‘Ilreep the key of my own breast.'

83. nuno, ‘for example‚' as Greek αὐτίκα. Cf. 468. subrupuisse,
archaic for surrepsisse.

84. On the use of local Roman allusions by Plautus, see Introduction.

85. columine, archaic for culmine. A statue of Jupiter Triumphator
crowned with laurel stood on the highest part of the Capitol. Cf. Men. 94¹·

86. suspicantes, archaic for suspicari. This was probably the
original termination of the passive infinitive¹ formed by the addition of

B
