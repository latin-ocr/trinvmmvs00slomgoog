old ablatival d (animant), as also in some twenty other passages of this
play.

si fiat. The apodosis is publica fiat basia. The clause nisi ia’ adpareat
is subordinate to the main protasis. ‘But if the authority, from which
they have heard each tale they tell, be sought out from its very root;
and if, in the event of it not appearing, it should be a matter of fine and
punishment for the gossip-if this should be done, it would be for the
