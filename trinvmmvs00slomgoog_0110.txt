l. 286. hiulca gans, ⁴ insatiate horde,' referring to the rapax, etc.

287. canto, ‘harp on! Cf. Ter. Phor. 495 cantilenam eandem canis.
Note the frequentative force, and cf. 350 cantari.

288. quo manus abstineant. The natural construction would be
eo manus abstinere. Here the relative clause follows fas, just as if it
were some such adJective as dagnus or idoneus.

289. The four imperatives are addressed to the hiulca gens.

290. quic duravi depends on lacrumas cliciuut, the indicative here
stating the fact, which is also the true reason. Nonquia with the
indicative expresses a fact. which is not, however, the reason; non
quod with the subjunctive denies both fact and reason.

291. quin, ‘why not? The following are the chief uses of quin in.
the cornio poets :-

(1) ‘why not,‘ either directly as here, or indirectly as in 495.

(2) with imperatives. Cf. 582 quin tu imodo. This arose from
the use with the second person of the present indicative where the sense
is equivalent to that of an imperative. Cf. 118 note.

(3) ‘because not.’ Cf. 341.

(4) in the common sense ‘but that’ after verbs expressing preven-
tion, doubt, and the like with a negative.

(5) a corroborative particle, ‘indeed’ ‘verily.’ Cf. 932.

euphemistic expression, like ol κεκμηῶτες Thuc. 3. 59.

me penetravi. Cf. 276 note.

292. lutitant, ‘sully’ (lutum, ‘mud'). Cf. 693 conlutulentet. Both
words are ἅπαξ hey.

29 3. gratiam facio (‘ make a favour ’), is not unfrequently found with
gen. in the sepse of to ‘excuse’ or ‘ pardon ’ something. So rather awk-
wardly, but quite intelligibly, with ne and subjunctive. ‘In the matter of
these pursuits I readily excuse you from training your young mind there·
with! This is a mild way of waming Lysiteles against them.

artibus. Cf. 72.

imbuo means ‘to initiate in any way? Cf. Virg. A. 7. 54² san-
guine bellum imbuit, ‘shed the first blood of battle3' Ovid A. A. 1. ⁶54
infelix imbuit auctor opus.

297. moror with negative=‘to let a thing go by,' hence ‘not to
value,' ‘have no liking for? Cf. 511, and Virg. A. 5. 400 nec dona
moror, ‘nor are gifts what Ι care for.’ In 337 below it is followed by
accusative and infinitive.

faemos, ‘ron’ ἅπαξ hey. Cf. lutitant ²9²·
