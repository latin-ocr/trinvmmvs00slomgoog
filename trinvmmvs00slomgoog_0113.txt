80 PLA VT I T RINVMM VS. 11. 2. 63-78.

l. 344. deiuvare, ἅπαξ hey.

345. ‘indeed shaming is better than blaming oneseli by every letter
of the w01·d.' A strong way oi asserting that pudere is in every way
better than pigere. To translate ‘though the number oi letters is the
same,' is possible, but lacks point.

348. ut pudeat must be explained by the general sense oi the pre·
ceding words: ‘do not blame yourseli sor having aided s friend: (blame
yoursell so little) that you rather feel shame‚' etc.

350. inmoeni (rather than inmuni here as well as in 243 but not
even there is it warranted by the MSS.; Lucretius has moenera three
times). This word has three meanings in the play, (1) ‘which gets no
nvocnera,' i. e. ‘thankless,' in ²43 (a) ‘who gives no moemra,’ i. e.
‘stingy,' in 3503 (3) ‘who does no nzoencra' (duties), in 354. In the
last two there is a play on the double sense ol the word: ‘do you know
the lines so osten quoted at the man who will part with nothing,' and
then 354: ‘he has no part in lile who has not the wherewithal to per-
form his part‘

cantari. Cf. 287; but perhaps here there is some notion ol
quoting a song.

solet. Colloquialuse. In other than comio writers the syntax
would demand the subjunctive.

351. ‘May you want your riches, and be rich only in your wants’
A. gives velim malum. Both words cannot stand. Ii the latter is
adopted, it can be taken with illud, or, as a vocative, ‘wretch ;’ but it
looks very like the addition of some' commentator to explain the phrase
quod non habes.

352· pote=potes here, and in a few more instances in Plautus. It
seems to be found also for posse. Pota sor potest is very common in
Latin. See Manro, Lucr. 5. 836.

354. moenus ninantur. cf. 1 note.

qui, ablative. ·

356. comitati simus, ‘be liberal' as in 333. For the construction
cf. usui csse, etc.

358. For the hiatus aster quoi cs. 604. '

359.hino. Cf. 326 note.

Charmidai. This form os the genitive is found in Plautus,
ior proper names in es, ior nouns oi the first declension in ·a
(often), and occasionally sor the feminine adjective, eg. magnai
Mil. 103. Terence has no instance of it. See Parry on Terence
And. a. 6. 8. (439). Lucretius uses it sor the substantive very
oiten; lor the adjective three times. ›Virgil has aulai, aserai, aquai,

pictai.
