11. a. 78-103. NOTES. LJNES 344-383. 81

· l. 360. quin=2'snequi.

361. nevolt. ef. 3²8 note.

362. mentire, ‘you mistake,' just like Greek ψεύδεσθαι.

365. multa illi opera opust floturae. It is not likely that Plautus
wrote this sentence as it stands, but perhaps nothing better can be ex-
tracted from the MSS.

opera (ablative) flaturae, ‘a man needs much practice in carving
who wishes to carve skillully the course oi his lise.¹ For ae esse
expetit cf. 3²4 volo me exorare.

367. epicureum a solitary instance os this verb in the passive sense.
Tacitus,' however, has adipiscendus. After this the MSS. give he
meaningless line-

Sapienti aetas condimentum, sapiens aetati cz'bust.

369. quiequam, pleonastic aster nil, as Ter. And. 90.

372, volo edoceas. Cs. 59 note. Ἴ

licet, an ordinary formula of assent. Cs. 517.

373. Note that the subject oi the dependent sentence appears as the '
object (illum) of the principal verb, a construction common enough in ’
Greek. cf. 88, 580, 698, 960.

374. adulta grandis, ‘grown-up and marriageable.' The two words
mean the same thing, and the expression is pleonastic sor the sake of
emphasis. For grandis cs. Ter. Ad. 673.

375. Note the position os -ne, asin 178, 515, 1022. Here, however,
a distinct reason can be assigned, since aine dote and uxoremne are
two separate questions.

377. auxiliariae. For the form cf. 86 note.

378. ut patiar, ‘(do you demand) that I should allow yon (to
marry)'l

379. lepidam famam, simply= ‘ good name)

380. quemvis adverbially with facunde, just as with longi, 797.
Cf. 554 note.

38¹· veterem atque antiquam. Tbese words are sometimes com·
bined (Lindemann, Mil. 3. 1. 155 note) to express two different ideas,
vetus=‘of old date,' antiqum,=‘os old character;' as Pliny, Paneg.
11. 4 homines veteres ct antiqui; cf. mores antiqui, 72; but as
applied to historia (‘stories') they are probably joined only ior
emphasis,

haec mea senectus sustinet, ‘my old head holds’ (Brix). lhe
point of this and the preceding line is, that Philto could argue ably
and learnedly against his son’s proposa13 but, as he goes on to say, he
prefers to give in.

383. istac, ‘in the way that you propose?
