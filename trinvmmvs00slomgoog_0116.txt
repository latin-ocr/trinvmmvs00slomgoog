407. This line is closely copied by Terence, Eun. a 57.

408. We need not trouble ourselves about the appearance of myro-
polae between holitorea and aucupes (poulterers). It is not likely that

clear to yon, if you content yonrself with spending,' i. e. and leave the
account to me; for then any limited sum (notice next line) must go.
(a) ‘if you are always spending, the money must be all gone,’ lit. ‘not
visible,’ as adparet in 419.

forum.
