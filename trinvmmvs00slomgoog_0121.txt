88 , PLAVTI TRINVMMVS. 11·4·124-139·

l. 525. Acheruntis ostium= Orci janua, or in Homer Ἀΐδαο asna
(Wagner). Acheruns (=Ae}uron) is Hades here, not the river as
m 494.

. 526. vinum=uva, while Horace, Od. 1. ao. 10, says tu bibes uuam

527. oonsuadet, ‘urges‘ i. e. not to accept the laudt cs. 670.

etsi scelestus est, ‘rascal though he is. heis still faithful to me,’
i. e. whatever he is about is lor my good. This use of at in the apo·
dosis is common.

529. post id. It is best to write this in two words. The forms
postidea and antidit (=anteit 546) may prove that pastid antid were
the original forms oi the prepositions, but not that Plautus used them.

530. tribus tantis minus redit, ‘yields three times as much less!
So Bacch. 1034 sescenta tanta reddam, ‘I will give back six hundred
ι times as much,' lit. ‘six hundred things as great’

illi, old sorm for illie, osten in Plautus and Terence, e. g. Phormio
91, where the metre makes the form certain.

531. This remark. like 545-552, is put into the mouth ol Philto, as
an indication that he does not believe the story ol Stasimus, though he
finds it cohvenient to affect belief.

53²· interfieri. The only instance of this form of the passive
infinitive.

' 534. quarm, probable correction sor quoium, ‘oi those to whom
it has belonged?

535. exulatum: exalatum, the spelling warranted byA, may point
to the proposed derivation from ex· -.salum

537. ut ad mersas reducunt, ‘has no longer anywhere to turn:
‘has not a move on the board,' lit. ‘has been reducedhs it were, to
immoveable calces,' or checkmated; calces, or more commonly the
diminutive calculi, were draughts, with which the game was played‚ a
player losing if his pieces were in a position where they could not be ⁸
moved. Cf. Poen. 4. 2. 85, where the phrase occurs, and also unam
calcem ciere, ‘to move a single piece‘

538. ex me, a correction sor the MSS. a me, which is against general
usage, and easily accounted for by a me in the preceding line.

539. alternis, sc. uicibus, ‘every other? This is a correction on
metrical grounds for the MSS. alternae. See introduction‚ xxiii.

540. The MSS. agree in giving sues moriuntur angina acerrume.
which involves an awkward hiatus It has been proposed to insert
acri, hic, or illi after angina. neither of the latter, acerrume might
be changed into acerruma, since acerrume mari is an odd phrase, though
aiter all not very unnatural in the mouth of Stasimus. Ritschl reads ara·
maed. Cl. 35 note. The penultimate of angina is short (Greek ἀγχόνῃ).
