throughout; and this has produced a similarly violent transition in
561, where there is no question of a lacuna.

l. 599. latrocinatum, ‘to serve as a mercenary’ (latro is connected
with λάτρις, a servant). Cf. Mil. 499, and Ter. Ad. 385 militatum.

Asiam, used in the common and restricted sense, as it was after·

wards applied to the Roman Province. The word was not employed
to mean the continent till much later.

600. huo, to the house of Callicles.

601. hio, Callicles himself.

Acr 111. 311111, 1.

Stasimus has told Callicles the news about the proposed marriage of
Lysiteles with the undowered sister of Lesbonicus. Callicles, hardly able
· to believe the story, requires Stasimus to repeat it, and then goes off to
ask the advice of Megaronides. Stasimus is beginning a soliloquy when
he is interrupted by the approach of Lysiteles and Lesbonicus, both
apparently much agitated.

Line 602. nostrum erilem filium, a common expression=nostri
crifilium.

603. em, hoo modo. Stasimus speaks testily.

604. quoi homini; for hiatus after quoi cf. 358.

605. in tantas divitias (cf. 1133), ‘into so wealthy a family? The
phrase also occurs Cist. a. 3. 57; Poen. 4. a. 82. Marriages both in
Athens and Rome were commonly arranged by the heads of the families
(as in the Phormio and at the end of this play) and the dowry was
always a primary matter for consideration: It was thought a downright
disgrace to a family, if an adequate dowry was not given with a
daughter who married a man of property. That a girl actually penni-
less should make such a match seemed to Callicles scarcely credible.

606. nullus, sometimes used for non by Plautus and Terence. Cf. ,

Ter. Eun. 216 (where see Donatus' note) ; Cic. Attic. 11. 24. 4.
oreduas, archaic for credas. Two archaic forms of the present
subjunctive of credo are found: creduum, creduas, meduan creduis,
creduit. No plural is found of these forms. Cf. 436 note.
607. credidero 3 for the tense cf. 60 note.
nihilipendere. Cf. flocci facere 211. Stasimus hates Callicles
for his supposed treachery to Charmides (cf. 600), and so gives free play
to his impertinenee.
608. quem dudumt) ‘how long ago l' cf. 1ο1ο; dudum also means
‘alittle while ago,’ or merely‘formerly.’ Cf. TenAnd. 5913 Phor. 459.
