Lysiteles endeavours to prevail on Lesbonicus not to insist on giving
away his last remaining piece of land as a dowry to his sister. Lysiteles
forcibly paints the ruin impending if Lesbonicus persists in his head·
strong course; bnt Lesbonicus is obstinate; he cannot endure the
thought of what his fellow·citizeus might say ii his sister were to
marry so rich a man without a penny of her own, and at last breaks
away abruptly, followed by Lysiteles, Stasimus being left alone to paint
iu a few graphio touches his probable future as a soldier’s manos-all·
work.

Line 627. ilico. Cf. 608 note.
neque te occultassis, ‘and do not hide your face from me’
Cf. 384 servassint.
⁶28. porin’=p0tisne. Τὶιε construction oi ut with the subjunctive,
or in negative sentences quin with the subjunctive, after posse is ex·
plained by the ellipse olfacere orfieri ; potest is often used impersonally
with this construction. Cf. 705, 730-731 (where sieri is expressed).
in rem tuam, ‘to your advantage'=cx re, opposed to ab re.
Cf. 238, 7483 Ter. And. 546.

gloriae aut famae; either (1) dativus commodi depending on
vrileatur erse, si not being again expressed as in 218. The change of
construction may be explained by the fact that in rem was a familiar
phrase, in gloriam was not. Or (2) the words may be taken as geni·
tives following in rem for the purpose of more accurate definitiou.
‘1f‚ lesbonicus, it should seem to be to your interest-to the interest, Ι
meari, of your fame and name!
aut. We might expect vel, since there is no essential opposition
between gloriae andfamae such as is usually introduced by aut.
631. meumst. Cf. 1²3 note, 445.
632. odio, the dative of the purpose.
⁶34· tu ne, ‘yes, you.’ Cf. 62 note.

639. quid agam, ‘what I have to do.'
640. quin rumori serviam, ⁴ from paying respect to public opinion)
oar. That Lesbonicus, who has been recklessly outraging all propriety
by his dissipation, should suddenly assume an exaggerated deference to
public opinion on this one point, istoo much for the patience of Lysiteles.
