devorti is used with a middle sense. An iun was called devor-
sorium i. e. ‘the place where you turn out oi the way!

675. ΤῙῙε MSS. read si istuc nt conarefan's indicium, tuum incendes
genus, which gives no good sense. The whole passage is very corrupt.

675-78. The simplest alteration is merely to place nt after coenare
instead oi before. The general sense will then be as follows :—‘ Is
you really attempt to do what you say, i. e. give away the last remnant
of your property as your sister's dowry, you will bring your family into
the greatest danger and disgrace. Then you will be taking some

, desperate step, as lovers are wont to do, to avoid the ruin staring you
in the face, and will enlist as a mercenary under some Asiatic prime,
with a good chance of never seeing your country again, and thus extin-
guish the last gleam oi hope ior the restoration of your family) Cf.
595·599; 700-7023 7²2·72l·

The metaphor of setting tire to a family probably includes the
danger of absolute ruin and the moral disgrace oi bringing beggary on
an illustrious house. The aquae cupido would be the overpowering
desire to put an end to so intolerable a condition by any means. As the
existence of a family was, in those days, typified by the fire on the
hearth, to extinguish the last spark would naturally imply the final
extinction oi the house.

The reading adopted by Ritschl, etc. (675),

Si istnc qnod conare faces, incendio incendes genus,
is ι conjecture os Nitasch.
