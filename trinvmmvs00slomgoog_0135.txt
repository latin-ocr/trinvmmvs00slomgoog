1. 835. quasi-hand secus3 ior the tautology cf. 756 note.

836. fremere, etc, the historic infinitive, making the description
more vivid.

837. ruere in the transitive sense is rare even in poetry3 not found
in classieal'prose (with one doubtful exception, Cic. Art. a. 15. a), ex-

' cept in the Past participle rutus. Cf. Ter. Ad. 319 ; Virg. A. i. 85, and

in five other passages.

ni pax, etc, is a repetition in altered form os the protasis in 83²
