ance. a practice alluded to in· the epilogue to the Cistellaria. Later,
however, it must have fallen into disuse; sor we hear (Tac. Ann. 1. 77)
that a proposal to flog actors was made in the reign of Tiberius, and
met by a dictum of Augustus, immunes verberum histriones. The
‘new aediles' must mean the aediles who had lately entered upon office
in March ; and so Ritschl proves from this passage that the Trinummus
was acted at the Ludi Megalenses, which took place on the fourth oi
April and the five following days. These games did not include stage
plays till nc. 194, as stated by Livy, 34. 54. Therefore the Trinummus
was not acted earlier than this date. ,

l. 990. meo arbitratu. Cf. 1140 meo datu. Τὴε hiatus aiter arbitratu

drowned 0n the way.' This is said παρὰ προσδοκίαν, as the Sycophant

1002. concentuum, ‘gather whole battalions of sear! Note the
military metaphor, so common in Plautus, used in a somewhat comic
sense.

1003. quam rem agat, ‘what it means‚' ie. the mille nummum.
Nothing is gained by changing this, the reading of the MSS, into agant.
Charmides is not so much concerned about the letters.

1004. tinnit tintinnabulum. Note the jingle of these two ono·
matopoeic words.

1005. nisiqui. Cf. 439 note.

1006. in plateam. Cf. 840 note.
