lv. 1. 1-17. NOPES. LJNES 990-1023. 109

l. 1010. ‘step out, hurry up ; it is long since you have left home.‘

1011. cottabi. As the noise of the falling wine was the chief feature
of the Greek game of κότταβος, Stasimus uses the word to represent the
cowhide falling ou his shoulders. The effect is greatly heightened by'
the alliteration.

1013. 01111. Cf. 9a5note. thermopolium is the Greek θερμοπὼλιον,
but thermopotare is a hybrid word, got from the Latin potare (observe
the differente of quantity).· Some vulgariam, such as ‘swilling·shop'
and 'swilled’ may serve for translation.

1014. gutturem, masculine, as in the two other passages where
Plautus uses the word, Mil. 835, Α11. 301. Cf. papaverem 410.

1015. recurre petere. The infinitive is often used by Plautus aster
verbs of motion. Terence has it 11101 mittere. Eun. 518.

1016. gurguliost exereitor, ‘has his gullet for driver,’ i. e. he stag·
gers about like a drunken man.

1017. tribusne 10 poteriis, etc, ‘(are you not ashamed) to hare
lost your memory after three glasses?’ poterium is the Gr. ποτήριον.

1018. Most editors place 1011 before 1020, 1011. The order of the
Mss. (given in the text) may be kept, if we consider 1010, 1011, 10
parenthetical. Stasimus, who is partly drunk, goes off into reflections
about the frugi homines, before he completes the construction. The
hiatus after oblitum can be explained by the stop.

1010. ‘close-fist, Cocktail‚ Catch-crumb. &ib-ring, Cakeling, Clatter·
necks, Clatter·shirs.’ These are comic names, which Stasimus invents
101 his companions.

ohrruohus :d χεῖρας ἔχων.

Corconiana is from κέρκος (1 tall), and νικάω, 1 compound to
which 10 very obvious sense seems to attach.

01111110 may be κρίμνον, ‘a crumb,’ by assimilation of m, though
κρίνον (1 lily) is given by Pollux, a writer of the second century 111, 10

1 an equivalent for a needy man.

collabua (ntiiaeosa‘a small cake ’), is best suited to the former.
