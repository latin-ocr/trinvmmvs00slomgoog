1v. 3, 46-59· NOTES. LJNES 1024-1066. 111

1. 1052. exigere, ‘dun for it ;' a much stronger word than repetas.

duarum rerum exoritur ontio is the main apodosis, the indica·
tive expressing a positive fact; this is amplified by the two following
clauses, which are subjunctive, as each indicates a possible result of si
occipias exigere. The general sense of the last two lines is,‘if you
press sorrhe repayment of a loan, either you will be met with a down·
right refusal, or, if successful, you will turn your former friend into an
enemy? But the lines are feeble, and the second seems an awkward
repetition of 1051. Possibly both are interpolated, and represent one
or two lines lost after 1051.

1054. venerit. Indirect, ¹(d0 you ask) how this has occurred to
mel'

¹ re ipsa is explained by 1056.

1057. rebus curem publicis. The dative after curare is not found
in the classical writers, but occurs several times in Plautus, e. g. Rudens
146,'18r.

1058. meo tergo tutelam garam, ‘act as guardian to my own
back ς’, tutelam gerere being a phrase which sometimes means ‘to take
charge of a ward ς’ cf. 870.

1059. Short dialogues, such as that contained in the nine following

, lines, where two persons meet in a street, and one of them does not
know to whom he is talking, are common in Plautus and Terenoe; but
it must have been difficult torepresent them on the stage without some
air of unreality. Stasimus, setting off home, may have got round the
street comer3 bnt even then he would not have sustained an argument
without looking to see with whom he was conversing.

te volo. Cf. 516 note.

1060. ah nimium, etc„ ⁴ gently‚ gently‚ Stasimus) Adverbs in decr,
formed from adjectives in -us, are common in early Latin, e. g. aventer,
amiciter, mundium later the termination -e became usnal; humaniter
and naviter are, however, exceptions to this usage ς and it should be
noted that saeve is very rare.

1062. quid ago=quid agam, deliberative.

magnum malum. Cf. 1045 note.
1063. e'ss. Cf, 47 note.
obnoxius, ‘ under obligation.‘ Cf. 269 note.

1066. quis boni, etc, ‘because the good and bad thereos is partly
yours.' The phrase is ambiguous. Charmides means ‘you are one of
my slaves; therefore their goodness or badness depends partly on you,'
but Stasimus, understanding mali in the sense of magnum errulum
(1062) says that Charmides may keep it (partem alteram) for himself,
and give to Stasimus the good (illam alteram quod borist).
