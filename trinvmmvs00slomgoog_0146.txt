trayed his trust, can scarcely be converted by one line (1096) notwith-
standing its even superfluous emphasis; and yet he begins 1098 with
credo. It would seem, therefore, that some lines have dropped out, in
which Callicles explains his acts. It is, however, just worthy ol
suggestion, that the explanation may have been given bya conversation
aside, seen but unheard by the audience, who might be occupied with
some by-play of Stasimus. We have heard Callicles ‚defend himself in
the first act of the play, and we do not want a reproduction of his dia·
logne with Megaronides. This would present a difficulty which Plautus
, may have been anxious to avoid. The digging up of the treasure for
the dowry is dismissed just below in one line and a half.

1·1099· sed quis est tuos ornatus? ‘but why attired thusi' i.e.
pallium off, and perhaps spade in hand, as traditionally represented.

1103. unum curriculum face, ie. ‘do not stop ou the way‚‘ as we
might say, ‘do it at a single straten?

. foce. Cf. 800 note.

1105. Rogationem, sorne servant of Charmides.

1106. simul, i. e. with Sagario.

1107. portitori. Cf. 794 note.

1109. illio sum etque hio sum, ‘Iam there and back again) an
emphatic way of saying ‘I'll lose no time! ·

1111. The MSS. here are confused and corrupt. Τ111 words liberos
absemt mei ιη’ are a mere conjecture to fill up a gap..

Acr V. Souna 1.

Lysiteles congratulates himself on his good fortune, and, having heard
of the arrival of Charmides, determines to obtain from him a formal
sanction of his marriage.

Line 1115. hic homo. Cf. 172 note. In omnium the last two syl-
lables are joined by synizesis and elided.

1116. antepotens, ‘proeminent' ἅπαξ λεγ.

1118. Here the MSS. give quod ago, adsequitur, subest, subsequitur,
a hopeless line, which ought to be removed or rewritten. Ritschl‚
adopting the latter course, produces quod ago, subit, adsecuc sequitur.
adsecus is coined by himself.

1119. 'Sojoys ure heaped on joys.’

1111. quas (neuter plural), used loosely for queam, as ci rei is
