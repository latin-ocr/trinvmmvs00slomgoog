1158. auri=aureum (1139), as in French ‘mille lonis d'or.'

· ,. dotem nil moror. · Cf. 511, ²97 note.

1159. placanda, a peculiar use of the gerundive, in the same sense
as the active placere. cf. 264 abuandus and note. It is possible that
placet and placenda-were suggested to Plautus by some Greek words,
e. g. ἀρέσκει aud ἀρεστός, the gerundive being an apparent translation of
the verbal adjective. So, too, abstandus might be got from ἀποστατέον.

1160. 11191, ‘take with it.’

1161. ius hio orat, ‘his plea isy'ust.’ Lysiteles in his reply keeps
np the legal character of the phrase. Oro in old Latin=dicm3 this
phrase, therefore, is not quite the same as ius petis Ps. 1313 ; ius orare
however, does not=ius dicere, which was technically used of the Praetor
pronouncing y‘udgment.

1163. adfines mei. Callicles as well as Charmides makes himself a
party to the sponsio; hence Lysiteles applies the term adfinis to
him also.

1166. Lysiteles implies that he is not to blame, though he does not
state it positively. ’ But the singular brevity of his defence has led most
of the editors to assume a lacuna aster this line.

1171. leviorem, ‘somewhat inconsiderate?

1175. ita aubitnmst, etc„ ‘so urgent is my wish lor a specdy inter-
